# 🌾 Naija Market Watch: Connecting You to Nigeria’s Food Economy (UI/UX Practice)



**Naija Market Watch** is a UI/UX design concept aimed at transforming how Nigerians interact with food markets. While this is part of my skill-building journey, the bigger picture is to drive **impact in Nigeria’s agricultural sector** using design, data, and technology.

------
## Mission for the App:

> To help everyday Nigerians from farmers to food buyers understand and respond to food price changes in real time.



## 💡 Why This Matters

Nigeria’s food market is vibrant but unpredictable. Many people—from smallholder farmers to urban consumers struggle to access real-time price information, track market trends, or even know the nearest food markets with the best deals.

-----

**Naija Market Watch** addresses this by providing:

- 📈 Daily Price History  
- 🔔 Price Alerts for when food prices rise or fall  
- 🛒 My Basket to monitor favorite food items and orders
- 📍 Nearby Markets with location-based updates  
- 🎯 **Fun quotes to keep users engaged

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Though this is a practice project, it reflects my deeper interest in:

- 🌱 Agricultural development  
- 🧠 Data-driven food systems  
- 📱 Designing digital tools for market transparency  
- 🇳🇬 Empowering communities through tech and research

I believe design is a tool for impact, especially in the food and agriculture space. This prototype is a seed—and I’m working on growing it into something real.

This is not a production-ready app (yet). It’s an educational, personal project designed to:
- Learn UI/UX prototyping
- Get feedback from the community
- Prepare for future real-world tools that serve Nigerian food markets
